This is the code that accompanies the article [Bayesian
Ontology Querying for Accurate and Noise-Tolerant Semantic
Searches](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/19/2502.long)
published in the [Bioinformatics journal](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/) in
2012.


Usage
-----

In order to start the benchmark, invoke the ```makefile```
within the ```boqa``` directory via ```make```. You need
Java, Maven, and R for successfully completing the benchmark
process. Look into the code for more details about the
implementation and how to use it in your own research project.
Remember that it also often helps to just read the supplied tests
to understand how to use an API. In particular, the BOQA
implementation is tested in BOQATest class.
